## How This Project Works (For Total Beginners)

This document explains every part of the code and the tools it uses, so you can understand how it all fits togetherâ€”even if you're new to Python, ffmpeg, or terminal video!

---

## What does this project do?

This is a terminal-based Python program that:
- Takes a video file (like an mp4)
- Converts it into ASCII art frames (text pictures)
- Plays the video as colored ASCII art in your terminal
- Plays the audio in sync
- Lets you pause, quit, and seek (rewind/forward)
- Cleans up after itself

---

## Key Concepts & Tools

### 1. ffmpeg
- **What is it?**
  - ffmpeg is a command-line tool for processing video and audio files. It can convert, extract, and manipulate media.
- **How do we use it?**
  - The code uses ffmpeg (via the `moviepy` library) to extract audio and frames from the video file.
  - The ffmpeg binary is bundled in a compressed archive (7z) for each OS (Windows, Mac, Linux).
  - The code extracts the right ffmpeg binary at runtime and sets an environment variable so `moviepy` can find and use it.

### 2. moviepy
- **What is it?**
  - A Python library that makes it easy to work with video files. It uses ffmpeg under the hood.
- **How do we use it?**
  - To open the video, extract audio, and get each frame as an image.

### 3. pygame
- **What is it?**
  - A Python library for making games, but here it's used just for playing audio.
- **How do we use it?**
  - To play, pause, and stop the audio in sync with the video.

### 4. PIL (Pillow)
- **What is it?**
  - A Python library for image processing.
- **How do we use it?**
  - To resize video frames and convert them to ASCII art.

### 5. colorama
- **What is it?**
  - A Python library for colored terminal output.
- **How do we use it?**
  - To color the ASCII art frames.

### 6. py7zr
- **What is it?**
  - A Python library to extract 7z (7-zip) archives.
- **How do we use it?**
  - To extract the ffmpeg binary from the right archive for your OS.

## How the Code Works (Line by Line)

### Imports
- The code imports a lot of modules. Each one is used for a specific job:
  - `os`, `sys`: File and system operations
  - `warnings`: Suppress annoying warnings
  - `contextlib`, `io`: For redirecting output and managing resources
  - `shutil`, `atexit`: For deleting temp files/folders and cleaning up
  - `time`, `threading`, `multiprocessing`: For timing, running things in parallel, and speed
  - `platform`: To detect your OS
  - `pygame`, `moviepy`, `py7zr`, `PIL`, `colorama`, `json`, `tempfile`, `queue`: See above

### SuppressStderr
- A class to silence all error output (so the terminal isn't spammed by ffmpeg/moviepy warnings).

### with SuppressStderr():
- All the heavy imports are done inside this block so their warnings are hidden.

### cleanup_temp_folder(temp_path)
- Deletes the temp folder and all its contents. Used to clean up after the program runs.

### find_resource_path(rel)
- Figures out where to find files (like ffmpeg or the default video) whether running normally or as a bundled executable.

### managed_ffmpeg()
- Context manager that:
  - Extracts the right ffmpeg binary for your OS from a 7z archive
  - Sets the `FFMPEG_BINARY` environment variable so moviepy uses it
  - Cleans up the temp ffmpeg file after

### get_stuff_from_video(vid, out, speed, wide)
- Converts the video to audio and image frames:
  - Extracts audio to an .ogg file
  - Extracts each frame as a PNG image, resized for ASCII art
  - Converts each frame to ASCII art (in parallel for speed)
  - Saves ASCII frames as .txt files

### load_options(options_path)
- Loads settings (like width, fps, temp folder) from `options.json`, or creates it with defaults if missing.

### pic_to_ascii_from_pil(pic, wide, high)
- Converts a PIL image to a string of colored ASCII art.
- Handles resizing, gamma/contrast, and color mapping.

### pic_to_ascii(img, wide, high)
- Opens an image file and calls `pic_to_ascii_from_pil`.

### convert_frame_to_ascii(args)
- Helper for multiprocessing: converts a frame image to ASCII art.

### play_sound(audio, pause_flag, stop_flag)
- Plays audio using pygame, with support for pause and stop.

### getch()
- Reads a single keypress from the user, non-blocking, works on Windows and Unix.

### clear_terminal()
- Clears the terminal screen (Windows or Unix).

### play_ascii_video_stream(...)
- Plays pre-rendered ASCII frames and audio in sync.
- Handles pause, quit, and keyboard controls.

### get_stuff_from_video_stream(...)
- Like `get_stuff_from_video`, but streams frames as they're extracted (for big videos).

### play_ascii_video_stream_streaming(...)
- The main playback loop for streaming mode:
  - Buffers frames
  - Handles keyboard controls (pause, quit, seek)
  - Keeps audio and video in sync
  - Only clears the terminal when needed (for performance)
  - Draws a seek bar and time display

### pic_from_ascii_txt(txt_path)
- Reads an ASCII art frame from a .txt file.

### main()
- The main entry point:
  - Shows a fancy intro box
  - Loads options
  - Gets the video file (from command line or prompt)
  - Calls the video extraction and playback functions
  - Handles errors and cleanup

### if __name__ == '__main__':
- Sets up signal handlers for cleanup
- Runs the main program loop
- Ensures temp files are always deleted, even if you Ctrl+C or close the terminal

## How does ffmpeg actually work here?
- ffmpeg is a separate program (not Python!) that can read and convert video/audio files.
- `moviepy` calls ffmpeg behind the scenes to:
  - Extract the audio track from the video
  - Extract each video frame as an image
- The code makes sure the right ffmpeg binary is available and tells moviepy where to find it.

---

## How does the ASCII art work?
- Each video frame is resized to fit the terminal
- Each pixel is converted to a colored ASCII character (darker = denser character)
- The result is a string of text with ANSI color codes, printed to the terminal

---

## How does the audio stay in sync?
- The code calculates how long each frame should be shown (based on fps)
- It starts the audio and video at the same time
- If you pause, both audio and video pause
- If you seek, both jump to the new position

---

## How do the controls work?
- Space: Pause/Unpause
- Q: Quit
- A/D: Rewind/Forward 5 seconds
- Arrow keys: Fine seek (left/right)

---

## How does cleanup work?
- The temp folder (with frames/audio) is deleted when the program exits, even if you quit early or force close.
- The ffmpeg binary is also deleted from temp after use.

---

## What if something breaks?
- The code tries to catch errors and print a message.
- If you see 'Nope, broke: ...', something went wrong (bad video, missing ffmpeg, etc).
- Check your video file, options.json, and that you have the right dependencies installed.

## Want to learn more?
- Look up the docs for: [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [moviepy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/), [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/), [py7zr](https://pypi.org/project/py7zr/)
- Try changing the options in `options.json` (like width, fps, chars) and see what happens!

---

## TL;DR
- This code takes a video, turns it into colored ASCII art, and plays it in your terminal with sound.
- It uses ffmpeg (via moviepy) to extract frames/audio, Pillow to process images, colorama for color, pygame for sound, and a bunch of Python magic to keep it all in sync and clean up after itself.
- You can pause, quit, and seek. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Enjoy!
