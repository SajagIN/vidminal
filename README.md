Ever wanted to watch videos as colored ASCII art in your terminal, with sound, and full keyboard controls? Now you can! This project turns any video into a glorious, eye-straining ASCII art experience‚Äîright in your terminal, with audio, seeking, and more.

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Download a Release (Recommended)
- Get the right executable for your OS from the [Releases](https://github.com/sajagin/vidminal/releases) page.
- No Python or dependencies needed. Just run it!
- All required files (including BadApple.mp4 and ffmpeg) are bundled.

### 2. Run from Python Source
- **Python 3.8+** required.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install Pillow moviepy pygame py7zr colorama
  ```
- Run the script:
  ```bash
  python vidminal.py
  ```

---

## üÜï Playback Controls
- **Space**: Pause/Resume
- **Q**: Quit
- **A/D**: Rewind/Forward 5 seconds
- **‚Üê/‚Üí (Arrow keys)**: Skip 1 second
- **M**: Mute/Unmute
- **+/-**: Volume Up/Down

---

## üçø Usage
- Run the script or binary. It will prompt for a video file (or use the default BadApple.mp4).
- All settings (width, fps, temp folder) are stored in `options.json` after first run. Edit this file to change defaults.
- The program will extract and use the correct ffmpeg binary for your OS automatically‚Äîno setup needed!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options (`options.json`)
This file is created on first run. You can edit it to change default behavior:

- **`temp`**: Name of the temporary folder for frames and audio (default: `temp`).
- **`wide`**: Default width of the ASCII art (default: `160`). The player will still resize dynamically to your terminal.
- **`fps`**: The frames-per-second to play the video at (default: `24`).
- **`ascii_chars_set`**: Choose a character set for the ASCII art: "`default`", "`detailed`", "`simple`", or "`custom`".
- **`chars`**: If `ascii_chars_set` is `custom`, this string of characters will be used (from darkest to lightest).
- **`gamma` / `contrast`**: Adjust the visual look of the ASCII video.
- **`audio_volume_start`**: Initial volume when a video starts (from `0.0` to `1.0`).
- **`default_video_path`**: Set a path to a video file to be used as the default if you don't provide one.
- **`show_ui_on_start`**: Show the fancy welcome box on startup (`true` or `false`).
- **`clear_screen_on_resize`**: Whether to clear the whole screen when the terminal is resized (`true` or `false`).
- **`seek_jump_seconds`**: How many seconds to jump with the `A`/`D` keys (default: `5`).
- **`fine_seek_seconds`**: How many seconds to jump with the arrow keys (default: `1`).

## üßπ Cleanup
- All temporary files (frames, audio, temp ffmpeg) are deleted automatically when the program exits, even if you quit early or force close.

## üìñ How Does It Work?
- See [WORKING.md](./WORKING.md) for a full, beginner-friendly explanation of every part of the code, how ffmpeg works, and how everything fits together.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Notes
- **Terminal Size Matters:** If your terminal is too small, the video will look bad. Make it big!
- **Performance:** It's Python and ASCII. It might stutter on slow machines or huge videos.
- **ffmpeg:** You do NOT need to install ffmpeg yourself. The right binary is extracted and used automatically.
- **Full video path is required (No relative path)**
