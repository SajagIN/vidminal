## üÜï Playback Controls
- **Space**: Pause/Resume
- **Q**: Quit
- **A/D**: Rewind/Forward 5 seconds

---

## üçø Usage
- Run the script or binary. It will prompt for a video file (or use the default BadApple.mp4).
- All settings (width, fps, temp folder) are stored in `options.json` after first run. Edit this file to change defaults.
- The program will extract and use the correct ffmpeg binary for your OS automatically‚Äîno setup needed!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options
- `options.json` is created on first run. You can edit it to set:
  - Video file (default: BadApple.mp4)
  - Temp folder (default: temp)
  - Width (default: 160)
  - FPS (default: 24)
- No more prompts for width, fps, or temp folder‚Äîjust set and forget!

---

## üßπ Cleanup
- All temporary files (frames, audio, temp ffmpeg) are deleted automatically when the program exits, even if you quit early or force close.

## üìñ How Does It Work?
- See [WORKING.md](./WORKING.md) for a full, beginner-friendly explanation of every part of the code, how ffmpeg works, and how everything fits together.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Notes
- **Terminal Size Matters:** If your terminal is too small, the video will look bad. Make it big!
- **Performance:** It's Python and ASCII. It might stutter on slow machines or huge videos.
- **ffmpeg:** You do NOT need to install ffmpeg yourself. The right binary is extracted and used automatically.
- **Full video path is required (No relative path)**
